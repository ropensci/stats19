Description: Tools to help download, process and analyse the UK road collision data collected using the
  'STATS19' form. The datasets are provided as 'CSV' files with detailed road safety information about the
  circumstances of car crashes and other incidents on the roads resulting in casualties in Great Britain
  from 1979 to present. Tables are available on 'colissions' with the circumstances (e.g. speed limit
  of road), information about  'vehicles' involved (e.g. type of vehicle), and 'casualties' (e.g. age).
  The statistics relate only to events on public roads that were reported
  to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the 'STATS19' collision reporting form. See
  the Department for Transport website 
  <https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data> for more
  information on these datasets.
  The package is described in a paper in the Journal of Open Source Software
  (Lovelace et al. 2019) <doi:10.21105/joss.01181>.

  Tait et al. (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.aap.2022.106895> for examples of how the data can be used for
  methodological and empirical road safety research.
