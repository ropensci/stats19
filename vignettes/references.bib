  abstract = {Road accident severity may be influenced by a number of factors. This article investigates the relationship between weather and road accidents in England and Wales. The weather information recorded on Police Accident Report Forms was taken as the prevailing weather at the time of the accident. At the local authority level, accident severity for the various adverse weather categories of rain, fog, and high winds is compared with the nonhazardous condition of fine weather. Severity ratios are then calculated. Findings establish that accident severity decreases significantly in rain compared with fine weather, while severity in fog shows geographical variation. Evidence for accident severity in high winds remains inconclusive.},

  abstract = {Built environment factors, especially street-scale design and traffic casualties, are intrinsically interlinked. Starting from Alker Tripp's seminal ideas about city design, street morphology, and accident risk, this article summarizes results from an increasingly sophisticated line of enquiry at the boundaries between transport geography, network modeling, urban geography, and planning. It goes on to specify what we believe to be the most comprehensive study yet, based on five years' worth of road casualty data from London; GIS data on street morphology and physical features captured at a street-link unit of analysis; socio-economics and other determinants of accidents; and individual data about casualty victims. We test hypotheses about links between urban morphology and casualty severity using multi-level models with individual victim attributes at level-one, street-link morphology attributes (various measure of network connectivity) at level-two, and neighborhood descriptors at level-three.Results indicate that street-level morphology and design (expressed in terms of betweenness, divergence ratio, and hull radius), together with traffic volume and physical features of streets are all significantly associated with odds of ``Killed and Seriously Injured'' (KSI) causality incidents. We find the strongest evidence yet recorded that London's 20-MPH speed-restricted residential zones reduce the incidence of KSI; while neighborhood-level factors such as population density, deprivation of living environment, and access to services are also significant predictors of KSI indicating that selective urban territorial enclosure can save lives.},

  abstract = {Background: Cycling is perceived as an unsafe travel mode in many countries. However, road deaths in England have fallen sharply since 2007. We explored whether differences in fatality rates by age, gender and mode persist, and the associations of deprivation with these. Methods: Using ONS (cycling, pedestrian) and Stats19 (driving) 2007\textendash{}2012 data for travel-related deaths, including pedestrian falls, and National Travel Surveys 2007\textendash{}2012 travel data, we calculated fatality rates for England by distance (f/bnkm) and time travelled (million hours' use, f/mhu) by age, travel mode, and gender or residential Index of Multiple Deprivation. Results: Fatality rates fell significantly 2007\textendash{}2009 to 2010\textendash{}2012: male f/bnkm from 2.8 (95\%CI 2.7\textendash{}2.9) to 2.0 (1.9\textendash{}2.1) for driving; 32.1 (28.5\textendash{}36.0) to 20.8 (18.1\textendash{}23.9) for cycling; and 51.4 (48.5\textendash{}54.4) to 36.7 (34.3\textendash{}39.3) for walking. Fatality rates varied by age, gender, and mode. Driving and walking fatality rate ratios were generally higher for males than females. For males 17\textendash{}20y, fatality rates were 0.76 (0.69\textendash{}0.83)/mhu for driving and 0.28 (0.18\textendash{}0.42)/mhu for cycling but were similar by distance. Age-specific rates were J-shape for cycling, U-shape for driving, and increased exponentially with age for walking. Fatality rates aged 80+ were an order of magnitude higher in each mode than the all-age mean. Compared with those aged 17\textendash{}20, rate ratios were significantly lower for male drivers 21+ and female drivers 21\textendash{}74, but were higher for male cyclists aged 55+ and pedestrians 45+ (male) and 65+ (female). People living in the most deprived quintile generally had higher fatality rates than those in the least deprived quintile overall (three modes combined) and for walking but not for cycling; Rate ratios were highest for pedestrians 35\textendash{}64 and drivers 35\textendash{}54. Conclusions: Fatality rates for walking, cycling and driving are higher for males than females at almost every age and vary more by age than by travel mode. Deprivation exacerbates walking and driving fatality rates.},

  abstract = {Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along `desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question `where to build?'. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based `cycling futures.' Four scenarios are presented, including `Go Dutch' and `Ebikes,' which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},
